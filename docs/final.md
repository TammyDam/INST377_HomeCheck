## Information problem
Many current buyers and renters have trouble finding housing violations codes or are unaware of these protocols. The specific problem is that it is very confusing and unintuitive to access the housing inspection violation data provided by Prince George's County.

## Stakeholders/target browsers
Our current stakeholders are prospective buyers and renters in Prince George's county. We would also include county administrators and inspectors. We hope that these people are able to use our app to help them learn about some of the housing violations that a home may have.

## Data
The data we decided to use was Prince George's County's house inspection violation data which was provided on the [county's website](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Urban-Planning/Housing-Inspection-Violations/9hyf-46qb).

## Strategies and Solution
Our solution to our information problem was to create a visual tool to help prospective buyers/sellers to find violations in an interactive manner. We are incorporating a map to help make the search process visually appealing but also practical. We hope that the interactions that we have implemented will help make the search process fast and easy.

## Technical System Rationale
We are specifically using leaflet on our front-end for the interactive map because it is an easy tool to implement and provides great results. We are also working with ReactJS as it provides a solid user interface that can provide the type of interaction we want people to have with our app. For the back-end, we are using Postman for API testing because it is a simple tool that provides nice feedback on HTTP requests as well as the responses.

## How Our Solution Works
By being able to provide a visual tool with search feature to see what houses have what building code violations, it helps buyers and renters of Prince George's County to be able to address certain issues and comply with county standards. With easy access to this information, people will be able to make necessary changes to help put their homes on the market without legal issues.

## Challenges and Impact of Design
One of the challenges we faced was working with ReactJS. Since this tool was not fully introduced in the class, we had to learn a couple of things on our own. Yet, we were able to work with ReactJS to implement an interactive navigation bar that's both computer and mobile browser friendly. Another major challenge of this project is the impact of COVID-19. Due to the pandemic event, many of our members are not as avaliable before, and we had to shift to remote meetings. This led to incompletion of some of our initial ideas. More speicifically, we weren't able to contact the Prince George's County for full access to their database through API and we didn't had enough time to create a local or online database that stores all the data from the database. 

## Future Direction
Some possible future directions we may take is to incorporate more data from other counties as well. In this may homes within the state of Maryland will be able to follow proper inspection codes. Another possible step that we could take is to implement some sort of interface for discussion. The idea behind this is to help connect buyers and renters with the updates that a home may have. In this way transactions can occur between buyers and renters with the necessary changes made.
