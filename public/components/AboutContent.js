        <p>
          Building code violations are problematic to prospective buyers and
          renters, as they can be costly to fix, and can pose a health/safety
          risk. We recognize the need for buyers and renters to know the
          building violations before purchase or rent; however, it's often
          difficult for them to find this information. For Prince George's
          County, although there is a database with all house inspection
          violations, it is not easily accessible to those who are trying to
          find information on a certain area or home. Hence, we propose
          HomeCheck as a solution to solve this information issue. HomeCheck
          compiles Prince George's County House Inspections data and creates a
          visual tool with a search feature to find violations. Our team hopes
          to provide a user-friendly web application that helps Prince George's
          buyers and renters to have easy access to building code violations. We
          strongly encourage buyers and renters of Prince George's County to use
          our application before deciding on any home property.
